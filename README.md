# Workout Tracker App

## Architecture Overview

This Flutter application follows a simple, modular architecture designed for ease of maintenance and testability. The key components are:

1. **Data Models**: Represent the core data structures (WorkoutCategory, Exercise).
2. **DatabaseHelper**: Manages all database operations using SQLite.
3. **UI Screens**: Stateful widgets that handle user interactions and display data.
4. **Main App**: The entry point that sets up the app and defines the initial route.

### Architectural Decisions

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a distinct responsibility, making the codebase easier to understand and maintain.

2. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class and function has a single, well-defined purpose.

3. **Stateful Widgets**: Used for screens that manage their own state, allowing for dynamic UI updates.

4. **Singleton Pattern**: Applied to DatabaseHelper to ensure a single instance manages all database operations.

5. **Asynchronous Operations**: Database operations are handled asynchronously to prevent UI freezing.

## Third-Party Packages

### sqflite: ^2.0.0+3
- **Purpose**: Provides SQLite database support for Flutter.
- **Reasoning**: Chosen for its robust implementation of SQLite, which is ideal for local data storage in mobile apps. It's well-maintained and widely used in the Flutter community.

### path: ^1.8.0
- **Purpose**: Provides common operations for manipulating paths.
- **Reasoning**: Used in conjunction with sqflite to manage database file paths. It's a core package maintained by the Dart team, ensuring compatibility and reliability.

### uuid: ^3.0.4
- **Purpose**: Generates unique identifiers.
- **Reasoning**: Used to create unique IDs for database entities. UUIDs ensure uniqueness across devices, which is crucial for potential future features like data synchronization.

### flutter_test (dev dependency)
- **Purpose**: Provides testing utilities for Flutter applications.
- **Reasoning**: Essential for writing and running unit and widget tests, ensuring code reliability and facilitating test-driven development.

### mockito: ^5.0.0 (dev dependency)
- **Purpose**: Creates mock objects for testing.
- **Reasoning**: Allows for the creation of mock objects, particularly useful for isolating components during testing. It helps in writing more focused and reliable tests.

### build_runner: ^2.0.0 (dev dependency)
- **Purpose**: A build system for Dart and Flutter projects.
- **Reasoning**: Used in conjunction with mockito to generate mock classes, streamlining the testing process.

### integration_test (dev dependency)
- **Purpose**: Enables integration testing for Flutter apps.
- **Reasoning**: Allows for end-to-end testing of the app, ensuring that different components work together correctly in a real-world scenario.

### sqflite_common_ffi: ^2.0.0 (dev dependency)
- **Purpose**: Provides FFI (Foreign Function Interface) implementation for sqflite.
- **Reasoning**: Used for running SQLite tests on the desktop, allowing for a broader range of testing environments.

## Conclusion

The architecture and package choices in this project aim to create a balance between simplicity, maintainability, and robustness. The modular design allows for easy expansion of features, while the chosen packages provide reliable solutions for common mobile app development challenges, particularly in data management and testing.
